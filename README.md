## Carolina Data Challenge Grad Track Project

This project pulls data from NASA's public API, specifically the Exoplanets database. 
Our goal with this project is to create a backend database that scores the habitability of exoplanets and allows us to see and rank habitability as well as qualities that allow habitability.
The front end is a interactive interface, designed with education and raising awareness and interaction with NASA research.
Built in Python

IMPORTANT: LAUNCH WEBAPP IN TERMINAL
